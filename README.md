# South-vs-North-major-swap

This was a project made in the Hack on the Hill hackathon, hosted by UCLA's ACM. It was created as a team with Erin Pool, Justine Bailey, and Tammie Yang. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was our first time using these languages. This submission won us the "Most Improved Team" award at the hackathon. 

Failing a class? Having a mid-quarter crisis? Switch to north campus!
